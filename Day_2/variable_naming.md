easily remembered and be associated with something that people are 
generally familiar with. 

## Python Variable Naming Rules

1. Variable have a lot of meaning and giving them appropriate names is 
very important in your journey to learning how to program. 

2. Rememeber variable names must be descriptive and also have a meaning 
which fellow programmers can understand and comprehend.

3. When naming variables, do not use special words or functions like print
output etc.

4. Remember variable can not have spaces between them or start and end 
with any type of number.

5. Variables can not start with a number.

7. Remember, variable names are case-sensitive. For example, (year, YEAR) 
are different variables.

should coresspond to its position. Don't put the variable for the 
first_name first on the line and then put them name last. In other words,
don't mix variables up that they end up having descriptions or titles 
which does not belong to them.
